# KPMG_Customer_Purchase_EDA:

 I have completed a virtual internship at KPMG via Forage about Data Analysis. I was dealing with a customer record of the purchase of different cycles of citizens living across Australia. I got to work with Excel sheets, each having multiple features to find relations that impacted their sales. The main task was to get the details of the customer's features and who would be their future customers. I learned to deal with the concepts of Data Preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis, and much more.
